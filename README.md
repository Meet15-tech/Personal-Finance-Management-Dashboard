# 📖 Project Overview

The **Personal Finance Management (PFM) Dashboard** is a full-stack MERN application that enables users to manage their personal finances efficiently from a single platform.

The application allows users to securely register, authenticate, connect their bank accounts, analyze spending patterns, create budgets, monitor income and expenses, and visualize financial data using interactive dashboards.

This project is being developed incrementally over **4 weeks** following professional software engineering practices as part of an internship program.
